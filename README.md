# landing-page
This is the second project I'm building while learning using The Oding Project's curriculum.
A snapshot of a webpage was given and I was supposed to attempt to recreate it. Colors, sizes and fonts were also pre-determined. I changed some of the text. 
I used purely HTML and CSS. It was all done in one day.
